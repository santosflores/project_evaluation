Example 2: Non-fiction (Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari)
Introduction

"Sapiens" traces the history of humans, from early hunter-gatherers to the 
modern age, focusing on how Homo sapiens became the dominant species on Earth.

Main Figures

Homo sapiens: The main subject of the book, as the species that has shaped human
history and the world.
Yuval Noah Harari: The author and historian who presents this account of human 
evolution.

Key Themes

Cognitive Revolution: The shift in human thinking and language that set us apart 
from other species.
Agricultural Revolution: How farming led to the rise of civilization.
Industrial and Scientific Revolutions: The more recent changes in technology,
economy, and science that have rapidly transformed society.

Main Points

Harari outlines how humans developed unique cognitive abilities, which allowed
us to form large societies and cooperate in ways other animals could not. The 
book examines the shift from small groups to large agricultural societies, and 
how religion, politics, and economics shaped modern civilizations. It ends with
a discussion of modern issues like biotechnology and artificial intelligence.

Analysis

Harari argues that much of human progress is based on shared myths—such as money, 
religion, and nations—that allow us to cooperate on a large scale. He also 
questions whether all of this progress has truly made humans happier.

Conclusion

The book leaves readers thinking about humanity's future, especially in the face 
of new technologies that might further change what it means to be human.
