Practitioners of Ayurveda — a traditional Indian medicine system — have used the ashwagandha plant for thousands of years. These days, another group is giving the plant a fresh surge of popularity: TikTok users.

People on the social media platform claim that the evergreen shrub, native to Asia, Africa and the Middle East, can boost concentration and immune health, dull emotions, weaken birth control and more. And while studies have found some benefits to supplements made from the plant, research gaps make it difficult to scientifically confirm many of ashwagandha’s purported properties.

“There are a lot of scientific research studies on it,” says Yufang Lin, an integrative medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. But “the studies have limited data.”

People often take ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) in the form of powders, capsules, tablets, liquid drops, or gummies containing extracts of the plant’s roots to help with stress or sleep. And research does show that the supplement can alleviate perceived stress and anxiety, as well as reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, compared with placebo treatments.  In one study, subjects rated their stress 44 percent lower, on average, after taking ashwagandha for 60 days. Some studies also suggest it can help people fall asleep a few minutes faster, sleep up to 25 minutes longer and wake up in the night up to 12 minutes less, with greater gains for insomniacs.

Experts say this could make the herb useful for those experiencing anxious, jumpy types of stress, like a student dreading an exam. Margaret Harris, a nutrition researcher at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, has studied the effects of ashwagandha supplementation on college students and has taken the supplement herself.

“After about nine to 10 days, the people in the intervention group started saying, ‘You know, I feel like I can … accomplish everything I want to accomplish today,’” Harris says, recalling one of her studies.

In addition to studies of ashwagandha’s impacts on stress and anxiety, a small pool of research reports other benefits in people such as reducing blood sugar, enhancing physical performance and muscle strength, boosting cognitive functions like memory and focus, and increasing testosterone, sperm count and sperm health in men. Ashwagandha may derive some beneficial properties in part from compounds called withanolides, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

And as far as experts know, ashwagandha doesn’t dull emotions or render oral birth control less effective, as some TikTok creators have said — though experts note there are occasional cases of users feeling too sedated, or having stomach pain or loose stool.

But the limited number of randomized, controlled studies investigating each touted use — and the limited number of subjects in each study — leaves ashwagandha’s confirmed benefits unclear.

“You’ll see with a lot of the studies that there are dozens of people [studied] as opposed to hundreds or thousands of people,” says Denise Millstine, an integrative medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. Making more conclusive statements about what ashwagandha can do, she says, would require more studies with “enough subjects involved to demonstrate power and not just chance.”

Even the more plentiful studies into ashwagandha’s stress and sleep benefits have had small sample sizes and lasted no more than three months, meaning experts don’t know the impacts of sustained dosage over longer periods. Experimental setups have also varied widely in dosage and type of preparation given to participants, making it difficult to know which amounts of which extracts are best.

Most studies have also examined ashwagandha in the context of Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian practice based on holistic healing. Millstine notes that while traditional botanical medicine practices like Ayurveda combine ashwagandha with other relaxants like chamomile, lemon balm and rhodiola, many people today take the herb by itself, so future research may benefit from comparing the two approaches

None of this necessarily means the plant isn’t helpful, Millstine says — only that more research is needed. “There’s a lot of wisdom in tradition, so that shouldn’t be thrown out the window just because there [is] a lack of randomized controlled trials.”

That’s especially true given that ashwagandha is generally safe, she adds. While certain groups should steer clear — notably pregnant people, since high doses can lead to miscarriage — for most people, “a lot of the studies are showing that it doesn’t really pose a lot of side effects,” Harris says.

Just keep in mind the plant isn’t a miracle cure-all, experts say. It may take more than a supplement to ease your mind if you have severe anxiety, or to help you sleep if you’re scrolling social media late at night. In Lin’s practice, she works with patients to develop better sleep, diet, mental health and exercise habits to manage stress and fatigue (SN: 2/21/23). “Ashwagandha may be a piece of the puzzle,” Lin says. But “you have to use it in [the] context of how a patient’s doing overall.”

James McCall: Solar production in the US really started to pick up around 2012. As solar really became mainstream, there was a lot more concerns of land use changes.

Ravi Sujith: If you look at the type of land that’s been converted for solar installations, over 60 percent of those landscapes are converted croplands.

Chong Seok-Choi: They both require flat areas with a lot of sun, and that’s close to transmission infrastructures. So in this context, it is important for us to figure out how to combine farming and solar power production so that both can exist in harmony.

McCall: Argivoltaics is a term for the colocation of solar and agricultural activities, such as grazing, crop production and also ecological restoration.

Sujith: Argivoltaics has multiple benefits, both for the farmers and for the solar developers.

McCall: If the solar developers can show they are using the land to the highest benefit, they can then access more land to develop more solar. And then the other big one is the farmer and the landowner themselves.

Sujith: Even if you lease out your land for solar development, you can still have an income generating activity like growing crops or sheep grazing.

McCall: There’s also the local communities that stand to benefit from that. It could potentially kind of create a pollinator habitat or prairie restoration.

Seok-Choi: Common practice used to be that people would leave the ground bare for solar construction, but that’s not how it’s done anymore.

Sujith: Covering the land with vegetation, they can avoid erosion and use it as an opportunity for soil carbon restoration.

McCall: Currently in the United States, there are roughly 530 (as of July 2024) argivoltaic sites. It’s a roughly fifty–fifty breakdown between pollinator habitats and solar grazing.

Seok-Choi: Right now, there’s a huge focus on letting sheep graze under solar panels, because they don’t jump on the panels, they don’t like to chew on wires or anything.

Sujith: Integrating the sheep grazing can also improve soil nutrients. So we just completed a five year study in the midwestern U.S. A lot of these areas have high carbon depletion because of intense agriculture. And we actually found that managed sheep grazing can actually improve old carbon and soil nutrients.

McCall: And so if it’s still the same cost as mowing grass and we can provide a benefit both to the local grazer and potentially the environment, why not to make it kind of part of their standard practice.

Sujith: So overall there is kind of an emerging consensus that solar grazing has some value in many of these landscapes. However, there’s a lot of unknowns when you are talking about crop production.

McCall: Of those 570 argivoltaic sites, only 40 are really focused on crop production. And a lot of those sites are these small scale research sites.

Sujith: So the first thing to consider is what crops do better, in what climates or what geographic locations? That’s a critical question, because some crops might do well under shade while some crops have significant yield losses under shade.

McCall: So even two varieties of the same tomato might respond very differently to the kind of microclimate that’s actually created by the solar panels. And then weather patterns are not constant every year. So it’s very hard to make some generalizations for kind of when and where crops would actually be available.

Seok-Choi: But other than that, crop production requires a lot of modification in the engineering and design.

McCall: We actually need to raise the panels high enough so they don’t get shaded or we need to spread the panels a lot further apart to actually get traditional farming equipment through there. Basically, all of the changes that need to occur come at a tradeoff of cost or you’re getting less energy. That is why we are seeing a little more hesitancy in the U.S. market.

McCall: We’re not going to do every system design everywhere, but where and when does this actually make sense, and why would different stakeholders want to do this? As we see climate changes such as reduction in access to water and kind of increased temperatures, that there will be this need to integrate solar. A prime example of this is wine grape production in California, where temperatures are currently too hot to actually produce certain varietals of grapes. And so they’re having to implement shade structures. And so why not also produce solar and make some money off of that shade structure.

McCall: Uhm, there’s also this broader need to grow food much closer to population centers.

Sujith: So currently we are trying to figure out what configurations of argivoltaic systems are suitable for our urban areas. We’ve set up an experimental system at Ambler Campus of Temple University, and which could fit into an abandoned parking lot or something in a city. So the idea is to compare, like how the solar arrays that are affecting these crops in different ways. It might actually improve yields of leafy greens. So we might be able to produce one more cycle of lettuce. But we still need to expand the study to other areas to see how the impacts are different. The next 10 years will be providing a lot of information on different types of integration. That could be applicable to different parts of the world.

Seok-Choi: And that is my dream. Where we can point at a map and say, like if we put panels here, the climate would be altered this way so we could grow this crop.

McCall: So this not a one size fits all pancea solution. It really requires some thought. It really requires a lot of different stakeholders to get their perspective in there. But more solar production can also help achieve climate change goals and so it’s a matter of necessity to make sure that we use this land for its highest benefit.

For the first time, scientists have measured a long-sought global electric field in the Earth’s atmosphere. This field, called the ambipolar electric field, was predicted to exist decades ago but never detected, until now.

“That’s the big whoop,” says atmospheric scientist Glyn Collinson of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “It’s a whole frickin’ new planetary energy field that’s never been measured before!”

The field is weak, only 0.55 volts — about as strong as a watch battery, Collinson says. But that’s strong enough to control the shape and evolution of the upper atmosphere, features that could have implications for the suitability of our planet for life.

“It’s fundamental to the DNA of our planet,” says Collinson, who reported the new measurement in Nature August 28.

The existence of the ambipolar electric field was first predicted in the 1960s, at the dawn of the space age. Early spacecraft flying over Earth’s poles detected a supersonic outflow of charged particles from the atmosphere, called the polar wind.

The most reasonable thing to explain that speedy wind would be an electric field in the atmosphere. The idea is that sunlight can kick electrons out of atoms in the upper atmosphere. Those negatively charged electrons are light and energetic enough that they want to float out into space. The positively charged oxygen ions left behind are heavier and want to sink down in Earth’s gravity.

But the atmosphere wants to remain electrically neutral, keeping an equal balance between electrons and ions. The electric field forms to keep the electrons tied to the ions and prevent them from escaping.

Once established, the field can act as a booster for lighter ions like hydrogen, giving them enough energy to break free of Earth’s gravity and zoom away as the polar wind. It can also pull heavier ions higher up in the atmosphere than they would otherwise reach, where other forces can strip them into space as well.

That was the hypothesis. But until recently, the technology to detect the field didn’t exist.

“It was genuinely thought impossible to do,” Collinson says. “[The field] so weak, it was just assumed you’ll never measure it.”

Collinson realized this measurement hadn’t been taken after he and his colleagues tried to measure a similar field on Venus. A search for a paper reporting the strength of Earth’s field for comparison came up empty.

“Turned out, funny story, it’s never been done,” he says. “We were like, ‘Game on!’”

Collinson and colleagues developed a new instrument called a photoelectron spectrometer specifically to detect the electric field. The team mounted the spectrometer on a rocket named Endurance, after the ship that carried Ernest Shackleton to explore the Antarctic in 1914.

Getting to the launchpad in Svalbard, Norway was a journey worthy of the rocket’s name. The team traveled by boat for 17 hours to get to the archipelago of Svalbard, located just a few hundred kilometers from the North Pole. Several members of the team fell ill with COVID-19 on the way. And the war between Russia and Ukraine had begun just a few months earlier.

“At the time, there was a certain amount of nervousness about firing off rockets,” Collinson says. “Polar bears were the least of it. We had war and plague.”

Two more days of blizzards kept Endurance grounded. When the rocket finally launched on May 11, 2022, it went straight up through the atmosphere to about 770 kilometers, measuring the energies of electrons every 10 seconds. The whole flight lasted 19 minutes. At the end, the rocket splashed into the Greenland Sea.

Endurance measured a change in electric potential of 0.55 volts between the altitudes of 248 kilometers and 768 kilometers — exactly enough to explain the polar wind on its own, without any other atmospheric effects.

The measurement is solid and exciting, says planetary scientist David Brain of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the new work. But it’s only one data point from one rocket. “I think this result is a really great result that argues there should be more measurements like this,” he says.

Collinson agrees. He and his colleagues recently received NASA approval for a follow-up rocket — this time named Resolute, for an Arctic exploring ship that set sail in 1850.

Because the ambipolar electric field helps control how quickly a planet’s atmosphere escapes into space, it probably plays some role in making a planet hospitable to life, Collinson says. Scientists think that Mars used to be more like Earth, but lost much of its atmosphere to space over time (SN: 11/27/15). Venus may have once been much wetter than it is today, too (SN: 8/1/17).

Both of those planets also have ambipolar electric fields, but they may have been better off without them.

“If this process didn’t exist at Venus and Mars, then I think it’s possible Venus and Mars would have lost less oxygen,” and therefore less water, Brain says.

Earth’s ambipolar electric field helps kick its oxygen out into space, too. But Earth has one key advantage over Mars and Venus: a global magnetic field to guide charged particles around the planet. “The electric field is the engine that gets the particles moving,” Brain says. “The magnetic field is sort of the road that the particles move along.” Earth’s magnetic field means oxygen can escape only near the poles, rather than from any part of the atmosphere. That could help explain why Earth has kept its habitable atmosphere for so much longer than Venus or Mars.

“Fundamentally, what makes a planet habitable is going to be many things,” Collinson says. “But I think comparing these different energy fields across different planets is a way to answer the question, why is the Earth habitable? Why are we here?”

In the first study of its kind, scientists have discovered that feeding bees absorbent bits of hydrogel boosts their chances of surviving exposure to toxic pesticides.

As key pollinators, bees provide essential services to both wild plants and human-grown crops. But the pollen they ingest is often contaminated with chemicals that can have devastating biological effects on the bees, such as spurring colony collapse or causing near-instant death.

Earlier studies found that particles of hydrogel – a soft, non-toxic material that is highly absorbent – mixed into soil can bind to and trap neonicotinoids, a class of pesticides widely banned in Europe, but still used in the US. That led Julia Caserto and her colleagues to investigate if small pieces of hydrogel could neutralise pesticides inside the bodies of common eastern bumblebees (Bombus impatiens).

“No one – to my knowledge – had done this,” says Caserto, who did the work while at Cornell University in New York.

The researchers began by mixing microscopic hydrogel particles – small enough to pass through the bee’s digestive tract, but not to travel elsewhere in its body – into sugar water. After the bees slurped the solution, researchers gave them a high dose of pesticides. Bees that received the hydrogel treatment had a 30 per cent higher survival rate compared with those that didn’t.

When the researchers gave bees doses of pesticides that would scramble their nervous systems, but not kill them, hydrogels reduced the insects’ symptoms. Bees that got the gel were better able to feed and walk than those that went without, and they beat their wings at a faster, healthier rate.

Because the bees eventually excrete the hydrogel particles, they would have to be continually re-dosed with the antidote. While this makes the treatment improbable for wild bees, it is still a promising option for human-managed bees, like those used for honey production and crop pollination.

“These particles could be incorporated into pollen patties or sucrose feeds that are already used for managed bee colonies,” says Caserto. “And hopefully, when bees go out in the field and get exposed [to pesticides], they will be less susceptible.”

Throughout our lives, we encounter individuals who inspire us and shape our values. These ‘exemplary’ figures, whether they are historical icons, public heroes or personal mentors, play a crucial role in guiding our sense of right and wrong. But how exactly do these exemplars influence our moral decisions? What makes some figures more impactful than others? And how can we find common ground in a diverse world with varying moral frameworks?

Nicholas Poole, a political theorist at York University, investigates these questions in his research on democratic theory and public freedom. Inspired by the writings of the 20th century political theorist Hannah Arendt, particularly her idea that our moral decisions depend on the company we keep, Nicholas aims to understand how exemplary figures shape our values and contribute to building a shared moral framework in a world of diversity.

Why are exemplars important?

Exemplars serve as role models who inspire and guide us throughout our lives. These individuals, whether well-known figures, like civil rights activist Rosa Parks and scientist Albert Einstein, or personal mentors, like a wise teacher or a courageous friend, embody qualities we admire and aspire to emulate. “The normative influence of exemplars is apparent in the ways we return to and repeat their lessons to ourselves. We surround ourselves with various reminders (like photographs, works of art, books or letters), and these may, in turn, shape our values, character and conscience,” explains Nicholas. The impact exemplars have extends beyond personal development – they also play a key role in public life, as seen when communities celebrate figures who embody shared values, or challenge monuments or statues that no longer reflect their ideals.

How do exemplars impact our judgement?

Exemplars play a vital role in shaping our judgement of right and wrong. They serve as tangible models of behaviour that we can consciously or subconsciously mimic. “Certain religious traditions, for example, explicitly promote the imitation of their founding figures,” says Nicholas. “A Christian may ask themselves, ‘what would Jesus do?’ or a Confucian, ‘what would Confucius do?’ and consciously set their actions by the light of such examples.”

However, in our contemporary world, traditional moral frameworks are less dominant, and individuals often choose their own exemplars based on personal values and beliefs. “Two key questions in my research concern what happens when we are exposed to exemplars that do not fit a given ethical framework, and what happens when our relation to them entails a high degree of personal freedom and responsibility,” explains Nicholas.

When we think about how exemplars influence what we think is right or wrong, we start to question whether we can still recognise morality if it depends on different examples. Why should we choose to follow people like Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi instead of someone like Adolf Hitler or a fictional character like Bluebeard? This raises a big philosophical question: how can we accept different role models without saying that anything goes? “My way of dealing with this problem is to consider the activity of judging itself, which, following Arendt’s thinking, is a mental capacity uniquely suited to pluralism – where different people, with different values share the same situation,” says Nicholas. “I believe that when our appreciation of exemplars is accomplished through judgement, we are led to endorse and keep company with those that, as far as we can see, promote the freedom and equality of the diverse range of people with whom we share the world.” Although there will be considerable diversity in the exemplars that shape individuals in a democratic society, such a society will reject exemplars like Adolf Hitler and endorse exemplars like Martin Luther King, because our judgement tells us that Hitler threatens the freedom and equality that a healthy democracy needs, while King promotes it.

How can we agree on exemplars in a diverse society?

“In contexts of pluralism, we cannot assume others share our exemplars,” says Nicholas. “One of the burdens of judgement is to accept that the exemplars that inform our sense of right and wrong may not be the same as those of our peers.” However, this diversity does not mean that we cannot find common ground. Instead of seeking complete unanimity, which can lead to rigid and authoritarian viewpoints, we should embrace the freedom and diversity inherent in democratic societies.

One way to bridge these differences is through storytelling. Sharing stories about the exemplary people and events that have influenced us invites others to understand our perspectives and creates a sense of shared experience. “Stories promote the active imaginations of listeners and make possible new beginnings from shared starting points,” explains Nicholas. “The potentially adversarial ‘I-you’ relationship gives way to a democratic ‘we’.”

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is an essential molecule in all living cells. It undergoes various chemical changes that influence its function and stability, and these modifications can have profound implications for human health and disease, biotechnological innovations and even agricultural productivity. A recent report by a 16-member committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), led by Professor Brenda Bass and Professor Taekjip (TJ) Ha, highlights the importance of sequencing RNA and its modifications, as well as the associated challenges.

What are RNA modifications?

RNA modifications are chemical changes to RNA molecules that happen during or after transcription. These modifications can alter the three-dimensional structure of RNA, change its abundance in a cell and influence its interactions with other biological molecules, all of which are important for maintaining life. “RNA modifications are known to be involved in regulating metabolism, circadian rhythm and the immune system,” says Brenda. “Research has also revealed that disrupting the cellular machinery responsible for editing and modifying RNA can lead to a wide range of diseases that include, but are not limited to, neurological disorders, heart disease, autoimmune diseases, cancer and diabetes.”

How can RNA modifications be beneficial?

“We’re still learning about RNA modifications, but what we do know has already been used to produce vaccines and medicines,” says TJ. “One prominent example is the development of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, which used the N1-methylpseudouridine modification to make them safe and effective.” These vaccines saved millions of lives and showcased the potential of RNA technology to create new therapies. Additionally, RNA modifications can revolutionise personalised medicine by enabling a more precise understanding of gene expression in different individuals, opening new avenues for treating genetic disorders, cancers and other diseases.

“Beyond health and medicine, RNA modifications show exciting promise for enhancing agricultural productivity,” says Brenda. “For example, engineering of RNA modifications has demonstrated improved drought resistance and crop yields in rice and potatoes.” Such advancements have the potential to boost food security for billions of people across the globe by ensuring more resilient and productive crops in varying environmental conditions.

Why can we not determine a ‘human reference epitranscriptome’?

“As we began our work, we were inspired by the Human Genome Project and its impact on shaping our modern-day knowledge of the DNA sequence of each gene, and in some cases, gene variants that correlate with disease,” explains TJ. “But each gene gives rise to dozens, sometimes thousands, of RNA molecules. Importantly, these RNA molecules are also subject to biological processes that chemically alter, or modify, their sequences.”

Unlike the relatively stable DNA genome, in which the single ‘human reference genome’ can approximately describe all humans, the ‘epitranscriptome’ (the collection of all RNA modifications in a cell) varies significantly between different cell types and changes in response to developmental stages and environmental conditions. This dynamic nature makes determining a reference epitranscriptome infinitely more challenging than determining a reference genome, as each cell can have a unique and constantly changing set of RNA molecules. This makes it incredibly challenging to define a reference epitranscriptome for an individual, let alone an entire species. “We came to the consensus that our task should not be determining an epitranscriptome, but evaluating how to develop technologies and infrastructure that would enable the determination of any epitranscriptome of interest,” says Brenda. This approach would allow doctors to understand the epitranscriptome most relevant to their patient’s condition, and scientists to explore the epitranscriptome most relevant to their research.

What are the current limitations in RNA sequencing?

RNA sequencing faces several limitations that hinder our ability to fully understand RNA modifications. One major challenge is the lack of a single method capable of identifying and sequencing all known RNA modifications, of which there are over 170 different types. And in addition to chemical modifications, RNA is also more prone to degradation than DNA, meaning RNA can be degraded and lost during preparation before sequencing. Also, with current techniques, it is difficult to capture comprehensive modification data in a single experiment – there is not yet a way to identify every modification and its abundance. To advance the field, we need innovations that overcome these challenges and enable end-to-end sequencing of RNA molecules that preserves information about all its modifications, ideally in a single experiment.

Looking to the future

“What we know about RNA modifications is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Brenda. “If we can better understand RNA modifications by improving our ability to sequence and study them on any RNA molecule from any living system, the possibilities are endless.” This enhanced understanding could lead to significant advancements in our fundamental knowledge of living systems, which would greatly benefit human health, agriculture and the environment.

“All of the conclusions and recommendations of our report are important, but a key conclusion that ties much of this together is that there is a need for a large-scale scientific effort focused on epitranscriptomics,” says TJ. “The Human Genome Project is a great example of how focused and concerted organisation and funding directed towards a set of well-defined goals can accelerate technological innovation in a field.” By embracing a collaborative, well-coordinated approach, we can unlock the full potential of RNA modifications. This concerted effort will push the boundaries of science and inspire the next generation of researchers to explore the uncharted territories of RNA biology.

In Ontario, Dr Jamie Fleet and Dr Stephanie Frisbee are studying the health data of people affected by strokes, depression and dementia. Their goals are to find out why these conditions are linked, how treatments can be improved and how health outcomes for these conditions change across different geographical areas.

 “Epidemiologic studies, that look at diseases and how they are spread, have shown that these conditions – stroke, depression and dementia – often occur together, and that having one of them increases the chance of having another,” says Stephanie, who is the founder of the Translational Health and Outcomes Research (THOR) Lab at Western University.

The concurrence of these conditions is likely caused by a few different things. Firstly, the permanent, debilitating effects that a stroke can have on someone’s life can lead to them developing depression. Secondly, the loss of blood to the brain during a stroke can either cause or worsen mental illnesses such as dementia. “As well as that, there seem to be common pathways including inflammation and changes to blood flow that affect all these conditions,” explains Jamie, whose work focuses on stroke rehabilitation and prevention.

Nowadays, people are living longer, which increases their chance of having a stroke, and living longer with disabilities. “Finding treatments for dementia and post stroke depression, and preventing future strokes, is important for a variety of reasons, including patient quality of life and healthcare spending,” says Jamie.

If healthcare providers can better understand how and why these conditions occur, they can intervene with preventative care methods that will hopefully stop or slow their development.

Health outcomes

“Since the late 1950s, and with significant advances from the biomedical research and public health communities, we have made huge strides in reducing the burden of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes,” says Stephanie. These advances have come from measures such as tobacco control policies to reduce smoking and the development of drugs such as statins, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which treat and reduce important risk factors that lead to heart attacks and strokes.

However, several studies suggest that the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases might be starting to increase again. “A recent study1 from the Global Burden of Disease projected that ischemic strokes will, in fact, increase in Canada between 2020 and 2030,” explains Stephanie.

One of the reasons for this is the ageing population in Canada, but there are other concerning, and preventable, factors too. “Several very important risk factors, including physical activity and fitness, diet and diabetes, are becoming substantially worse in many countries, including Canada,” explains Stephanie. Additionally, access to primary care – such as getting a quick appointment at your local health clinic – is declining in Canada, which is leading to certain high-risk health factors not being picked up before they develop into more serious problems. “Canada does not have an integrated, cohesive electronic healthcare information system,” says Stephanie. This creates further challenges to controlling high-risk health problems.

Jamie and Stephanie are building upon previous research that assessed the quality of care that patients received after having a stroke. “Our analyses will assess how well patients who have had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) receive outpatient, follow-up care designed to control risk factors for a subsequent stroke or TIA. We are also studying how many people who have a stroke or TIA in Ontario go on to develop dementia,” says Stephanie.

Stephanie and Jamie are using a dataset from ICES (formerly the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences), an independent, non-profit research institution in Ontario that looks at health services and outcomes across populations. “This dataset includes data from all over Ontario, so our study will provide a good snapshot of the quality of post-stoke and post-TIA care in the province,” explains Stephanie. Stephanie and Jamie are hoping to divide some of the results by health regions in Ontario, to see how living in a different area of the province affects health outcomes.

Follow-up care

Follow-up care prevents the risk of further harmful conditions developing, ensures patients recover as best as possible, and helps healthcare professionals understand what happened and why. A stroke, for example, is usually a sign of a more advanced underlying disease; follow-up care allows doctors to investigate a situation fully and understand what else might be going on.

It is especially critical to have good follow-up care and support after suffering from a stroke or TIA as there is a significant chance of having a second stroke or TIA. Similarly, one in three people who have a TIA will have a stroke sometime in the future.

Jamie and Stephanie’s findings

“Our research is showing that not enough people get the appropriate care, like lab work and flu shots, after they’ve already had a stroke in order to prevent another one,” says Jamie. “We don’t currently know why that’s the case, but identifying these gaps is a first step to addressing them.”

Jamie and Stephanie’s research is ongoing. “We sincerely hope that our results will highlight the gaps in care that Ontarians are experiencing and that it will be part of the push to make the changes to the healthcare system needed to improve the quality of healthcare in Ontario,” says Stephanie.

With much analysis to come, Jamie and Stephanie are hoping that their future work will lead to improvements of health outcomes for the most amount of people possible.

A healthy adult human produces over 200 billion red blood cells every single day. Each of these cells contains a protein known as haemoglobin, which is essential for transporting oxygen around our bodies and keeping us alive. Producing these blood cells, and the haemoglobin contained within them, requires iron, and lots of it. This is just one of the indispensable roles that iron plays within our bodies. It is an essential element for almost all living organisms, and without it, humans would not survive. 

Unfortunately, you can always have too much of a good thing. Humans are unable to expel excess iron from our bodies, and if it builds up, it can become toxic and make us ill. Balancing the iron levels in our bodies, a process known as iron homeostasis, is a delicate act, but one that is key to our survival. 

Dr Kostas Pantopoulos, a biomedical researcher at McGill University, and his former PhD student Dr Edouard Charlebois, currently post-doctoral fellow at the XSeed labs, are studying the complexities of iron regulation and homeostasis. Using genetically modified mice, they are exploring the role that the liver plays in keeping our iron levels balanced. 

How does iron move around the body? 

Our bodies cannot make iron, so all of the iron that we need must come from our diet. This iron is absorbed in the small intestine and passes into the bloodstream where it binds to transferrin, a protein that transports it around the body to the cells that need it. 

When the transferrin reaches a cell, it binds to a receptor known as transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1). “Tfr1 provides a docking site for transferrin and is essential for iron delivery to cells; this is why it is often called the ‘cellular iron gate’,” explains Kostas. 

How does the body regulate iron? 

The liver plays a central role in iron regulation. Not only is it the main site of excess iron storage in the body, but it also produces the hormone hepcidin which regulates how much iron we absorb from our diets. 

Hepcidin is produced by cells in the liver called hepatocytes. As iron levels in our body increase, more of it begins to be stored in the liver. Hepatocytes sense when iron levels in the liver begin to rise and produce hepcidin to prevent us from absorbing any more iron. When iron levels are low, hepatocytes stop producing hepcidin so that we can start absorbing iron again. 

Kostas and Edouard experimented with genetically modified mice to investigate the role that Tfr1 plays in this process of iron regulation in the liver. “We generated mice with specific disruption of Tfr1 in hepatocytes,” explains Kostas. “Surprisingly, we observed that the mice were developing normally and did not exhibit any signs of disease.” These results show that hepatocytes are able to acquire iron without the key transferrin receptor, Tfr1. 

“Nevertheless, the mice had significantly less iron stored in their livers and were unable to adjust their production of hepcidin to balance their iron levels,” adds Kostas. “The most important conclusion of this study was that Tfr1 is not essential for supplying iron to hepatocytes but rather has a ‘systemic’ function in the control of hepcidin expression and overall body iron regulation.” 

In order to carry out this systemic regulation, hepatocytes need to be able to sense the amount of iron in the body. The process by which hepatocytes do this is not well understood, and is another focus of Kostas and Edouard’s research. 

How do hepatocytes sense iron levels in the liver? 

“Earlier work suggests that circulating iron in the bloodstream and liver iron stores stimulate hepcidin expression by different mechanisms,” says Kostas. As we absorb iron into our bloodstream, transferrin molecules fill up and become saturated. This increase in transferrin saturation is sensed by another type of receptor, transferrin receptor 2 (Tfr2), which activates hepcidin production. 

“The mechanism by which increased liver iron stores induce hepcidin is more complex and is not completely understood,” says Kostas. “We know that endothelial cells in the liver secrete proteins called bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6) and bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) which bind to receptors on hepatocytes and activate the production of hepcidin.”

Hepatocytes are the most common type of cell found in the liver and play a key role in iron homeostasis.



Kostas and Edouard hypothesised that the endothelial cells detect high iron levels through Tfr1. To test this hypothesis, Kostas and Edouard used genetically modified mice that had no Tfr1 on their endothelial cells to see if the mice could still regulate their iron level. “Surprisingly, these animals responded appropriately to dietary iron challenges, refuting our initial hypothesis,” says Kostas. 

Using a state-of-the-art technique known as ‘single cell transcriptomics’, Kostas and Edouard continued to explore this problem. “We observed that acute intake of high dietary iron rapidly saturated transferrin, resulting in the accumulation of ‘non-transferrin bound iron’,” explains Kostas. “Our overall data suggest that BMP6 expression in endothelial cells in the liver is primarily caused by non-transferrin bound iron, rather than transferrin-bound iron.” 

In other words, when our iron levels become too high, transferrin becomes saturated and cannot carry any more iron. The excess iron circulates through the bloodstream as nontransferrin bound iron, which is detected by endothelial cells in the liver. These cells then secrete BMP6 which signals nearby hepatocytes to start producing hepcidin, preventing us from absorbing any more iron from our diets. 

Why is this research significant? 

Understanding these processes is crucial for insights into liver function, physiology and the development of liver diseases. “The progress from basic science to clinical applications has been rapid, with significant advancements achieved in just over two decades since the discovery of hepcidin,” says Kostas. “This progress highlights the importance of foundational research in animal models to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for human diseases.”

When someone is recovering from surgery, doctors and nurses must keep a close eye on them to check whether the operation has been successful and to ensure they are healing well. One method currently used to do this is to periodically monitor the patient’s blood flow, as this can alert healthcare professionals to any potential problems. However, regularly removing bandages to check on the wound can be uncomfortable for the patient and can delay the healing process, which is why researchers are looking for better alternatives.

Why is collaboration essential for solving challenges?

Solving real-world challenges such as this requires interdisciplinary teams of researchers, in which each person brings their own skills, knowledge and perspectives to address the problem. A team of electronics engineers and surgeons at the University of Surrey in the UK and Gachon University in South Korea has assembled to develop a solution to the issue of post-operation blood flow monitoring. Together, the researchers are designing a wearable electronic device that can be placed over a wound, under a bandage, to continuously monitor a patient’s blood flow as they recover from their operation.

“With this collaboration, we pool our engineering skills in flexible electronics and circuits with clinicians who understand the practical needs,” says electronics engineer Dr Radu Sporea, who is leading the project. “At the University of Surrey, we have electronics engineers who are experts at creating the amplification electronics and clinicians who are performing incredible feats of surgery. Our colleagues at Gachon University have extensive knowledge of photosensors and electronic component integration. Together, we bring complementary skills, which increases our chance of success.”

What are flexible electronics?

If you have ever looked inside your phone or laptop, you may have seen the circuit board (or ‘motherboard’) which controls the system – it was probably a rectangular piece of dark green, rigid plastic covered in tiny metallic components. In contrast, flexible electronics refer to circuits that are built on flexible substrates. This allows them to change shape, making flexible electronics suitable for a huge range of applications, especially in the field of healthcare where they can be used to create wearable devices that can continuously monitor a patient’s condition.

How does the wearable blood flow monitoring device work?

There are several ways of measuring blood flow, most of which rely on changes in pressure or blood volume in a patient’s blood vessels. Radu’s team chose to use an optical method, in which light-emitting diodes (LEDs) shine light of a particular colour through the patient’s skin and photosensors detect what proportion of that light is transmitted. As the heart beats, blood is pumped rhythmically through the blood vessels and so the intensity of transmitted light changes. The sensors convert the optical signals into electrical signals, which are sent to a smartphone to be analysed.

All these electronic parts – the LEDs, sensors, and conversion and amplification components – are built on a flexible substrate to form a wearable electronic device with a thickness of less than a tenth of the width of a human hair! This ultra-thin blood monitoring device can be placed over the patient’s wound under the bandage, where it will continuously monitor their blood flow as the wound heals and send this information to the doctor. “The innovation in our device is in the way we integrate the optical-electrical conversion elements with signal amplification components in a low-cost, reliable and comfortable sensor,” explains Radu.

What challenges did the team face?

“Energy consumption and cost of manufacture are always at the top of the list for any wearable electronic system,” says Radu. If a device is not cost-effective, it will not be viable to create and use. Developing flexible electronics that are tiny but robust and reliable is not easy. “When designing electronics, you are stacking materials on top of each other,” explains Radu. “By the time you make transistors, photosensors and other components next to or on top of each other, the biggest concern is to protect the layers already made from any processing that might follow.” Radu’s team have often had to choose materials that work well together, but at the expense of maximum performance. This has led to a balancing act as the team develops components that meet all required specifications.

As the blood flow monitoring device connects to a smartphone, it is limited by the processing power of an average phone, and so it is important that the signals are transmitted as clearly as possible. “For many years, we’ve been developing electronic structures called source-gated transistors, which are very good at amplifying signals while using extremely low energy,” says Radu. “The main challenge is to integrate these transistors with the photosensors and LEDs to create sensing pads that have consistent performance and are comfortable for patients to use.”

The challenges of creating flexible electronics mean they are still in their infancy, but, with further investment and development, they have the potential to bring huge benefits for patients and healthcare professionals. The team’s wearable device for post-operation blood flow monitoring is just one example of how flexible electronics will revolutionise healthcare. As Radu says, “Our project is a small step towards making flexible electronics a reality!”

What do you think of when you hear words like ‘positron’, ‘antimatter’ and ‘high-energy photon’? Physics is full of exotic-sounding terms that we might associate with science fiction, and even real physicists, such as Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger, can take on surreal and almost mythical personas. It can be easy to forget that these words equate to real-life phenomena, and these scientists made discoveries that have practical implications in our daily lives.

Every day, in hospitals all over the world, doctors use the laws of physics to diagnose and treat their patients. X-ray machines, ultrasound devices, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and positron emission tomography (PET) scanners were all developed using concepts and theories based in physics. These techniques capture internal images of parts of the body, allowing medical professionals to diagnose a wide range of health conditions, from broken bones to cancer.

At the University of California Davis, Professor Simon Cherry and Professor Ramsey Badawi have taken biomedical imaging one step further. They have developed the EXPLORER total-body PET scanner, the world’s first biomedical imaging device that can capture an image of the entire body in a single snapshot.

What physics theories lie behind PET scanners?

“Before having a PET scan, the patient is injected with a tiny amount of radiotracer,” explains Simon. “One common example is a sugar molecule that has been modified to contain the radioisotope fluorine-18.” After injection, the radiotracer circulates throughout the body and is taken up by cells. The more metabolically active the cells are, the more radioactive sugar they take up. This is diagnostically useful because, during certain diseases, the body changes how it uses sugars. For example, cancer cells often accumulate much more radioactive sugar than surrounding tissues, meaning they can be visually detected on a PET scan. The major clinical application of PET is to look for cancer cells in patients.

About an hour after the patient has been injected with the radiotracer (allowing time for it to be distributed throughout the body), they are placed inside a PET scanner, which can detect the signals coming from radioactive decay. “When a fluorine-18 atom in the radiotracer undergoes radioactive decay, it emits a positron,” explains Ramsey. “Positrons are antiparticles of electrons, meaning radioactive decay produces antimatter!”

However, matter and antimatter cannot coexist for very long. Almost immediately, the positron will find a nearby electron and both particles will be annihilated. In the process, the positron and electron disappear, and their mass is converted into energy according to Einstein’s famous E = mc2 equation.

This energy is released as two high-energy photons emitted in opposite directions. The radiation detectors in the PET scanner look for this signature pair of photons arriving simultaneously on opposite sides of the body, indicating that radioactive decay has occurred. During a single PET scan, hundreds of millions of decay signals will be detected, which reveal where radioactive molecules are concentrated in the body, indicating the location of cancer cells or other abnormalities.

How does EXPLORER differ from conventional PET scanners?

The EXPLORER scanner is an incredibly complex machine with over half a million radiation detectors and more than 50,000 electronic channels. “This rivals the complexity of the detectors used in the big particle accelerators found at places like CERN, home of the Large Hadron Collider!” says Simon.

Conventional PET scanners have a small array of radiation detectors and can only image part of the body at a time. To study the whole body, a patient is moved through the scanner step by step (which is time-consuming) and then the individual scans must be ‘stitched’ together. In contrast, EXPLORER has many more radiation detectors that cover the entire length of the body. This allows it to capture images of the whole body in a single scan – the world’s first biomedical imaging device to do so.

How does EXPLORER benefit patients and biomedical researchers?

With detectors covering the whole length of the body, EXPLORER can detect radiation much more efficiently, gathering a lot more information. For a given scan time or radiation dosage, EXPLORER can collect 40 times more signal than a conventional PET scanner, providing many benefits for patients and biomedical researchers.

For example, EXPLORER can collect higher quality images which could enable diseases to be diagnosed earlier. It can conduct scans 40 times faster, meaning a total-body scan can be completed in less than two minutes. “This is fantastic for patients who can’t stay still for long periods of time, such as young children or patients in a lot of pain,” says Ramsey. Or, for a standard scan time, the patient can be injected with a radioactive dosage that is 40 times lower. “This is great for patients who need regular PET scans.”

“But the real game changer,” says Simon, “is that EXPLORER can see the radiotracer wherever it is in the body at any moment in time.” This allows scientists to observe how substances are transported around the body, delivered to tissues and metabolised by cells, providing insights into how the entire body functions. “This offers truly exciting prospects for the future!” says Ramsey.

How did Simon and Ramsey develop EXPLORER?

In addition to the technical challenges of developing such a complex machine, Simon and Ramsey also had to overcome the practical challenges that come with creating a new invention, in particular, the issue of money. “It was a 15-year journey from first ideas to first images,” says Ramsey. “The first 10 years were very frustrating, as the idea of a total-body scanner didn’t interest the biomedical community, so we couldn’t get any funding.”

This all changed in 2015, when Simon and Ramsey finally received a large grant from the NIH, providing the money necessary to start building the system. In 2016, they joined forces with United Imaging Healthcare, a medical imaging company with the physical resources to build the scanner. “After that, the project moved incredibly quickly,” says Ramsey. “Our first full-body images were acquired in 2018, and we started using EXPLORER for clinical use in 2019. Now, there are almost 20 EXPLORER total-body PET scanners around the world, which have scanned well over 100,000 people. Other companies also are making similar scanners, which shows that the idea is now catching on.”

“Looking back, it has been an exciting and worthwhile journey,” says Simon. The team’s dedication and persistence paid off, and thousands of people are now benefitting from the technology Simon and Ramsey have developed. Having improved the diagnosis of cancer, Simon and Ramsey envision that, in future, total-body PET will be combined with other advanced techniques (for example, genomics and proteomics) and artificial intelligence to predict how the human body responds to health challenges and diseases, revolutionising biomedical understanding.
